# ANIMALGAME

CONTENT OF HW
In this homework, you are asked to develop animal finder game for children under age of 6. In this
application, you will show images of some animals on screen and ask children to click which of the
animal to be found. Your application needs to talk with children because they often do not know
how to read at that ages. For instance; the application asks “Find the lion, Lion makes sound:
Roarr!” and shows images of random animals below including lion. If they click the right answer,
you will give points, and talk : “You got it” or something more appropriate for children. You can
decide talking text for your own application. If children click on wrong answer, your application
will talk appropriately indicating the answer is wrong. You need to design the application consisting
of 5 levels:
Level 1: Choose correct animal from 2 animals,
Level 2: Choose correct animal from 3 animals,
Level 3: Choose correct animal from 4 animals,
Level 4: Choose correct animal from 6 animals,
Level 5: Choose correct animal from 8 animals.
Three (3) consecutive answer will increase level by 1. Wrong answer ends current game. You can
start the game from beginning by showing dialog box according to user answer. Best point in the
game will be saved. Please update it appropriately when it is surpassed. Best point should be seen in
the user interface (UI). You need to download at least 20 images of animal and their sound from the
Internet. It does not have to be an image, it can be drawing or vector representation.
Activity layout design is important. I encourage you to use handy libraries for android UI design.
The design of an application is up to you. The evaluation of the homework will be accomplished
according to following criteria's:
1)(25p) Layout design. The user interface should be simple and attractive. Check for good
applications in the market for having an idea about how to build a better interface.
2)(25p) Code clarity, readability, maintainability.
3)(40p) The levels are working properly.
4)(10p) The best point is working properly.
5) (15p) Bonus. If you add timing for children to answer, you will get bonus points. In the first level
it can be 20 seconds, and decreased by 3 seconds in each level.

I GET FULL POINT FROM THIS HW :))
